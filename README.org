#+title: Wikinforg
* Intro
=Wikinforg= is a [[https://github.com/progfolio/wikinfo][wikinfo]] front end for converting Wikipedia's infoboxes into Org entries.

It offers two commands:

- =wikinforg= ::
  Insert the result of a wikinfo search as an Org entry.
- =wikinforg-capture= ::
  Similar to above, but designed with =org-capture= in mind.

* Installation
This software is still in an experimental state.
I make no API/behavior guarantees at this point.
If you'd like to experiment with it, the easiest way to install is with the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/][straright package manager]]:
