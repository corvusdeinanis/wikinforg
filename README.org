#+title: Wikinforg
[[https://melpa.org/#/wikinfo][file:https://melpa.org/packages/wikinfo-badge.svg]]

=Wikinforg= is a [[https://github.com/progfolio/wikinfo][wikinfo]] front end for converting Wikipedia's infoboxes into Org entries and items.

It offers two commands:

- =wikinforg= ::
  Insert the result of a wikinfo search as an Org entry or item.
- =wikinforg-capture= ::
  Similar to above, but designed with =org-capture= in mind.
